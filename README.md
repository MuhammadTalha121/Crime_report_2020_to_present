# Crime Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes crime data from a CSV file containing information such as crime codes, locations, victim ages, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that can analyze both text and numeric data to predict crime occurrences.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the CSV file with crime data.
- `crime_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the data analysis and model building code.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for running the code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the dependencies using the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadTalha121/Crime_report_2020_to_present.git
```


2. Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `crime_analysis.ipynb` to analyze the crime data and build the predictive model.
